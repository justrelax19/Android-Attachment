# Attachment-In-Android

First of all Splash Screen concept is used to display the front page of the app.
After the front page, a screen will open up which will be like the Email but with a few changes.
Here you can attach the images and videos by clicking on the attachment button and it will be attached where the name, photo and the size of the object will display. There is a close button also to remove the notifications. After that , in the same page there is a Floating Label Editext in which one can provide the details of the attached file.

After doing all the task, click on the send button. It will show the dialog box with progress bar for 5 seconds and after that it will disappear. If someone have to post in on the server or somewhere else, they can use AsyncTask with doinBackground override method.
